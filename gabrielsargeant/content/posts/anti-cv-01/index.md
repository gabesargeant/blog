Surveillance presents a problem for society and individuals. Thankfully, it's less of a problem for you, me, and this site. I don't collect logs or capture analytics on anything. The only reader of this site that I know anything about is my poor wife, who I lovingly encourage to proofread all of this... 

Back to surveillance. Now days, there's a lot of technology that now exists that detects and tracks people. It's mostly your phone. But there's other stuff. Face stuff! And that's what I'm going to focus in on with this. 

There may be some phone stuff as well, read on to see. 

**On we go**

Some folk don't like the trend towards a more visible and accountable population. They are pushing back against the technology of facial recognition. They state both ethical and privacy reasons to oppose the technology. In addition to the virtuous, there is also be spies and regular criminals in there as well. I'm not going to repeat their arguments, the virtuous or otherwise here. Instead, I'll be writing about the technology. 

If you do want to read them, have a glance at [Social Cooling](https://www.socialcooling.com/)

*side note:* 
*a more visible and accountable population* -- I get triggered when people say accountable. Usually it means there person saying the word accountable is shifting blame for their shit leadership... ask me how I know. ಠ ∩ ಠ

**And finally onto face stuff**

The current thinking about defeating face detecting surveillance technology follows a few different approaches. All have limitations.

**Option 1.** Hide or disappear in plain sight. 

- CV Dazzle [CV Dazzle](https://cvdazzle.com/). There's a pretty good warning about how most of this doesn't work anymore.

```June 15, 2020
Attention: whether a look works or not is up to you. CV Dazzle is a concept, not a product or pattern. Evading face detection requires prior knowledge of the algorithm. Most of the archived looks on this page were designed over 10 years ago for the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. Current face surveillance uses deep convoluational neural networks (DCNNs). To use CV Dazzle you must design according to the algorithm (hint: don't use Viola-Jones looks for a DCNN face recognition system).
```

- **Glasses**. I have seen various version of this. Similar in mechanism to Isao Echizen's glasses.

{{< img src="anti-photo-glasses.jpg" alt="Isao Echizen's Anti Photography glasses." >}}My big concern is wrecking my already terrible sleep patterns by disrupting my circadian rhythms. I'm not even sure if this is a thing, but I do have the warm night light settings on for a reason.

- **Masks**. COVID has made wearing cloth face masks acceptable in the West. So, there may be some options here. [Buy one on amazon! AFR - Face Mask](https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Face-Recognition-Surveillance-Pattern/dp/B08JTM6S8C/ref=pd_lpo_193_img_1/134-9237156-6814251?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B08JTM6S8C&pd_rd_r=852d8eb6-0f46-4166-ae2c-97fa4ec06eff&pd_rd_w=8V502&pd_rd_wg=FCY99&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=JBVSC5FGSH2AYSQ724SQ&psc=1&refRID=JBVSC5FGSH2AYSQ724SQ)
Extra to this, there are a few more esoteric versions listed in this article. [Business Insider - Out smart facial recognition](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/clothes-accessories-that-outsmart-facial-recognition-tech-2019-10?r=US&IR=T). 
Or, you can try the ever ever [creepy human looking mask.](http://www.3dprintingnews.co.uk/3dprinting-3/create-your-own-doppelganger-with-3d-printing/) It's worth noting that masks didn't last long. People are working around COVID.

**Option 2**. Break your existing signature by,

- looking like someone else, or look like everyone else. I don't think this is practical. The dlib blog has a really cool post about [Fast Multiclass Object Detection in Dlib 19.7 ](http://blog.dlib.net/2017/09/fast-multiclass-object-detection-in.html) which snuffs out this approach.

- Try out CV-Dazzle like approaches to change points of the face with makeup. Easily countered with cross matching on other data. If you go through a FR checkpoint that has the ability to identify you, then it's probably they can capture things like your cell phone hadware MAC address, which is a much richer source of metadata.

- Use post processing techniques on your image to be constantly make yourself unique. This is an attach on the search index, not on the system that detects your face. It's smart when you consider the cost and complexity of facial recognition systems at scale. 
It's a SAS product for local LEO. 
Pollute the well. 


There's a general problem with all of these face-based approaches. You still have a set of shoulders and a general outline to deal with. And you usually have a phone on you.

So hold all of that in your head and I'll swing back to it.

**Where does facial recognition happen now?**

- Right now it's happenign at Clothing stores, Airports, and a ton of other places. But I'm going to talk about airports. But here's a great article about the technology used in retail [Revealed: how facial recognition has invaded shops – and your privacy](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/03/revealed-facial-recognition-software-infiltrating-cities-saks-toronto)

What does facial recognition in an airport look like. 

- Controlled environment.

- Predictable lighting makes things simpler for a the system. 

- people groomed by other systems into conservative behavior and dress.

- Less social acceptance of facial coverings
    - try wearing a black motorcycle helmet into bank or airport. It'll be a short trip. You'll probably be confronted by security then arrested or detained.

The airport is a really significant touch point for picking up a whole swag of biometrics. Firstly, it's totally opt in for the person being surveiled. Simmilar to the car parking in the city. If you don't want to pay the price, park elsewhere. Travel is a modern luxury and governments control airports. 
And thus, airport security get the ability to make a person walk down a hallway where an image/video can be captured that controls for speed of walking, captures gait information, height, estimated weight, if not actual weight, and then a high definition picture of the face. Bang, you're in the system. 

Can't win, don't try.


**Problems with trying to counter being detected.**
Humans have been vilifying those who are different for longer than we've had computers. Avoiding facial recognition needs to include a strategy that is either widely adopted, or covert in application. So essentially you need to learn, then use covert personal counter survelience techniques to live out your daily life.

**Target Pattern Analysis, Why use facial recognition technology at all**

Think like you need to track yourself. Pretend you have to tail someone like a detective. Or better yet, a big group of detectives or spies. 

It's very expensive to provide human eyes on a person all the time, sometimes they are asleep, other times they are shopping or working. Not often are they being a criminal or a spy. But that time is important, and it's what's different.

People are creatures of habbit. Knowing that and depending on risk It's usually cheaper if you can establish a pattern and then monitor the conformance to that pattern. 

Think about your habbits. For me, I work, I walk my dog, I go to Bunnings to buy supplies to fix my house. Sometimes I sleep. Everyone once and a while, my endless house chores are done and I take myself for a relaxing drudge through nature. Breaks from the pattern are noticeable. 

**If** you wanted to establish my pattern, you'd use my phone. I always have it. I like to entertain the idea that I could leave it behind, but it's always with me. 

Would facial recognition actually be of assistance to establishing my pattern? I don't think it would when technology like Dirt Boxes and the [Gorgon stare.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon_Stare) exist.

Is facial recognition really the issue here?

**Targeting is tricky. So is Identification and creating a facial index. Let's have some compassion for the Surveiller's IT team.**

*fun fact, first time I think I've ever used the word Surveiller*

In my humble opinion, the biggest question is, do you want to ID all faces? Or do you want to be able to select someone and then ID them?
The next biggest question. Do you want to be able to search for a face live, or is time no object?

If I was building the system, any answer to any of those questions would make me rich! :P

Got to index faces, fast!
Create a searchable index of those
OLAP or OTAP structures
How much history do you keep?

How good is the data, how big is the data? And what size is the population of people you're looking to track? All of that information feeds into a the spreadsheet that stops the IT project in it's track when you figure out you can mine bitcoin cheaper. Or at least you create

**It's an arms race**

FR, the cabability is pretty simple. And the Genie is out of the bottle. 


**A few solutions I can think of to defeating FR technology**

Context is important. 

- If you're protesting, 
Wear masks, but not unique masks and disguises, like the CV dazzle but **not** the [Guy Fawkes masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask)you see about. Wearing one of those and protesting *the man* is like paying $40 dollars and wearing a red shirt with Che Guvaras face on it. Unless your doing it ironically it's just stupid. 
But course, if you are an investment banker and are wearing a Che shirt to a party to celebrate increasing the cost of food by commodifying the developing worlds grain supply. Then, bully for you.  
Look at the Officers who police riots. 
    - No name tags. 
    - Same helmets and uniforms. 
They don't get doxxed because you can't find the individual. It's an effective approach. However, you'll absolutely become a gang like the ever [oppressed juggalos](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/15/550724673/who-are-the-juggalos-and-why-are-they-marching-in-washington-d-c)

- If your engaging in serious criminal misconduct. 
    I'm not helping here, reconsidier your life choices. Or you know, go with the classics and just wear a balaclava. 

- If you're guarding your preception of your privacy. 
Stop carrying your mobile phone. It's a greater threat to you. Do you know what a [Dirtbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirtbox_(cell_phone)) is?
