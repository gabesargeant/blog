Surveillance presents a problem for society and individuals. Thankfully, it's less of a problem for you, me, and this site. As I don't collect logs or capture analytics on anything. The only reader of this site that I know anything about is my poor wife, who I lovingly encourage to proofread all of this... 

Back to surveillance. Now days, there's a lot of technology that now exists that detects and tracks people. It's mostly your phone. But there's other stuff. Face stuff! And that's what I'm going to focus in on with this. 

There may be some phone stuff aswell. 

**On we go**

Some folk don't like the trend towards a more visible and accountable population and are pushing back against the technology. Their reasons both on privacy grounds and ethical. But there'll also be tax cheats and regular criminals in there as well. I will not repeat them here. Instead, I'll be writing about the technology. 

*side note:* 
*a more visible and accountable population* -- I get triggered when people say accountable. Usuaully it means there person saying the word accountable is shifting blame for their shit leadership... ask me how I know. ಠ ∩ ಠ

The current thinking about defeating face detecting surveillance technology follows a few different approaches. All have limitations.

**Option 1.** Hide or disappear in plain sight. 

- CV Dazzle [CV Dazzle](https://cvdazzle.com/). There's a pretty good warning about how most of this doesn't work anymore.

Attention: whether a look works or not is up to you. CV Dazzle is a concept, not a product or pattern. Evading face detection requires prior knowledge of the algorithm. Most of the archived looks on this page were designed over 10 years ago for the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. Current face surveillance uses deep convoluational neural networks (DCNNs). To use CV Dazzle you must design according to the algorithm (hint: don't use Viola-Jones looks for a DCNN face recognition system).

- **Glasses**. I have seen various version of this. Similar in mechanism to Isao Echizen's glasses.

{{< img src="anti-photo-glasses.jpg" alt="Isao Echizen's Anti Photography glasses." >}}My big concern is wrecking my already terrible sleep patterns by disrupting my circadian rhythms. I'm not even sure if this is a thing, but I do have the warm night light settings on for a reason.

- **Masks**. COVID has made wearing cloth face masks acceptable in the West. So, there may be some options here. [Buy one on amazon!

Extra to this, there are a few more esoteric versions listed in this article. [Business Insider - Out smart facial recognition](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/clothes-accessories-that-outsmart-facial-recognition-tech-2019-10?r=US&IR=T). 
Or, you can try the ever ever [creepy human looking mask.](http://www.3dprintingnews.co.uk/3dprinting-3/create-your-own-doppelganger-with-3d-printing/) It's worth noting that masks didn't last long. People are working around COVID.

**Option 2**. Break your existing signature by either,
- look like someone else
- Try out CV-Dazzle like approaches to change points of the face with makeup.

The overall problem with all of these face-based approaches. 

You still have a set of shoulders and a general outline. 

Hold all of that in your head

**Where does facial recognition happen now?**

-Airports, and a ton of other places. But I'm going to talk about airports. 

What does that look like. 

- Controlled evnrionment. Th

- Predictable lighting 

- people groomed by other systems into conservative behaviour. 
- Less acceptance of facial coverings
    - try wearing a black motorcycle helmet into bank. It'll be a short trip. You'll probably be confronted by securitity or at worst arrested!

The airport is the most significant touch point for picking up a whole swag of biometrics. Firstly there's the ability to make a person walk down a cattle crush where an image/video can be captured controls for speed of walking, gait distance, height, probablly weight if not actual weight, and then a high definition picture of the face. Bang, you're in the system. 



Problems with trying to counter being detected.

*One more aspect of machine learning to take into account: Nobody really knows what the algorithm is using to make its decision. Say, for instance, you want to train an algorithm to recognize a cow. “You think you’re showing the model a bunch of examples of a cow, but you don’t realize that in order to come up with the label of cow, [the algorithm] might be looking at the grassy fields in the background,” Raji says.*


**Target Pattern Analysis!**

Pretend you have to tail someone like a detective. Or better yet, a big group of detectives. How expensive would 

Phone is a bigger risk

London terrorists, traced back via cctv. 

Gorgon stare. 

This is less a technical problem and more social one. 

The cabability is simple. And the genie is out of the bottle. 

Targeting is tricking, Identification and creating a facial index. 

**Compassion for the Surveiller's IT team.**

*fun fact, first time I think I've ever used the word Surveiller*


Biggest question, do you want to ID all faces, or do you want to be able to select someone and then ID them?
Next Biggest question. Do you want to be able to search for a face live, or is time no object?

If i was building the system, any answer to any of those questions would make me rich! :P

Got to index faces, 
Create a searchable index of those
OLAP or OTAP structures
How much history do you keep?

How good is the data, how big is the data?
