Hi I'm Gabriel Sargeant. I do IT stuff for work. A lot of my job is plumbing and configuration. A lot of what I like to do is to make things. 

This site mostly exists to enable me to be able to share stuff I build via a link from this site rather than a link to a random EC2 instance on AWS as naturally most people are a little hesitant to click an odd looking ec2 links.

#### About this Theme
Based on https://themes.gohugo.io/smol/
I'm going to learn more hugo and change it over time. Infact i've already started. Though it's got the best css by far.

The options at https://themes.gohugo.io/ were a little distracting. 
Smol is basic and works on everything.
