Hi I'm Gabriel Sargeant. I live in Tasmania and I do IT stuff for work. A lot of my job is plumbing and configuration. A lot of what I like to do is to make things. 

This site mostly exists to share stuff I think about and build. 

I don't intend to host tutorial style content. I want to document things I think about and build. If only to be able to look back and smile at my own ignorance.

The adventure begins..
