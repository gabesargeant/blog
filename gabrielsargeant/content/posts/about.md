Hi I'm Gabriel Sargeant. I do IT stuff for work. A lot of my job is plumbing and configuration. A lot of what I like to do is to make things. 

This site mostly exists to share stuff I think about and build. Whilst I don't intend to do much paint by numbers, or tutorial style content I do want to document things I think about and build. If only for myself to be able to understand what the hell I was thinking later on.

The adventure begins.
