Hi I'm Gabriel Sargeant. I live in Tasmania and I do IT stuff for work. I like building stuff!

This site mostly exists to act as a record for the things I think about and build. 

I don't intend to host tutorial-style content. I just want to document things I think about and build. If only to be able to look back and smile at my own ignorance.

The adventure begins...
