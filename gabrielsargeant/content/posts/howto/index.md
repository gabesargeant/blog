There's a rhythm to the writing on this site. 

It generally follows this flow.

1. I have an idea. -- blog post. 
2. I do something with that idea. -- blog post.
3. I finish off / reflect and regret steps 1 and 2. -- blog post. 

Some things will have an ongoing number of step 2 posts with a sprinkle of step 3.  
Anyway, if you're stumbling around this site. Sorry. I didn't name things in a way that indicates there's links between posts. Dates of posts and timestamps are the best hints.  
I only usually have one project happening at a time. Other than that, I procrastinate by tweaking this site. 

The other way to gauge what stage a post is in the sequence, is by reading the title and picking a face that lines up with the tone of the title.

1. The idea phase usual has a naive smile. 
2. The doing phase, has everything. But any writing about it will probably be framed with the furthest face to the right. Mouth open with anger, shock, and disbelief at my past self.
3. These posts will have a title that matches the middle face. Numb and worn down by endless work. Why, oh why...
