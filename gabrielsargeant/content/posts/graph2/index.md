Before you read this, read what came before this. Graphs and the ASGS Part 1.

Got slightly distracted by the 2020 election. Who didn't!

General Approach.

Need to build Two Trees.

All have a trunk at the Austrlaia Level, but one is the ASGS the other is non asgs regions. 

They join at the leaves. 

I then need to create a process to walk the graph and build objects that show those pathways between each of the non asgs to asgs.

I want to avoid having meshblocks as part of the output. Rather, I'd like to have abstract them into SA1.
