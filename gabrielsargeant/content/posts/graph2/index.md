Before you read this, read what came before this. [Graphs and the ASGS Part 1.]({{< relref "/posts/graph1/index.md" >}} )

So... I Got slightly distracted by the 2020 election. Who didn't!. I think I watched like 96 hours of CNN. Won't be doing that again for ~4 years.
This was a super helpful distraction because this little jaunt into the ASGS has kinda turned into a tiny bit of a death march. Anyway, I think I have a way forward.
    
**General Approach.**

I'm going to build two graphs. Or two tree's which I will join onto mesh blocks forming one graph. 

{{<image name="tree2.png" alt="Possible new output tree">}}

All have a trunk at the Austrlaia Level, but one is the ASGS the other is Non-ASGS regions. 

They join at the leaves. 

I then need to create a process to walk the graph and build objects that show those pathways between each of the non-ASGS to ASGS.

The POA and SSC areas are roughly like SA2 in sizes, both in population and physical space. Though in Australia you can find an example that breaks every rule. Because of this general similarity I'm going to omit outputting the Mesh Block and SA1 levels. Rather, I'd like to abstract them into SA2's as references that show the chain.

**Thoughts so far**
