I'm Gabriel Sargeant.  
This is my sub 1kb site.   
I've been building software for work for about the last 10 years. First at the ABS, now at CSIRO.  
I like making stuff.   
I love when the internet loads quick.  
Sometimes I blog when I have ideas and spare time.    
Frustratingly, I have less and less of that these days.    
This all started when I got trapped by covid.   
The rest of my blog is a bit bigger and uses 10s of kilobytes per page. It still loads quick :)
