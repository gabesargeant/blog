# My fancy new Sewing Machine

I like making stuff. Sometimes I make things that are programming related, and other times it's more real, like painterly paintings (more on this later) or lino cuts. Recently it's been making stuff with my fancy new beast of a sewing machine. 

For Christmas 2021 my awesome wife got me a fantastic Singer heavy duty sewing machine. It's a beast and I love it. My overarching goal with it is to be able ot make things like packs or bags, But I also really wanted to try proper garment construction. 

# The skirt
Recently, I had a go at sewing a shirt for my wife. specifically this skirt, the simplicity s9387. She wanted the A style with the C-Style length so 


# My first attempt.

# I think we don't pay enough for our clothing. 
All up it too me about ~1.5 days of efforts to go from a pattern, to a toile, and then to actual skirt. Tack on another 2 hours for  buttons and button holes as well. 

Anyway, the broad point was it was a tone of effort. Over time I'd get quicker, but it's a lot of work. So my price for this skirt is $500 AUD. 

More broadly, I can buy cheap a dress shirt for $20 dollars. Someone is being done over on the effort there. I don't think the person doing the work is getting a stack of money for their effort sadly.


# Pipelines make things quick.

I already knew that pipelines are magical in their way of speeding up manufacturing, data processing, processor computation etc. But it also applies to sewing things. 

In a garment factory, you wouldn't see someone working like I was on one thing at a time slowly building one item. Rather you'd have 5-10 people sitting in a row doing the same small few steps. And there'd be one person at the end who'd be the final step that'd result in a garment. 

I won't post the pattern instructions here, as they are not mine to share, but there's about 20 steps to the process. 
You could see breaking the work up into a few people building the skirt and a few people doing the yoke, and then someone joining those pieces and finally someone hemming and top stitching the thing. 

# If you pay attention the detail in every day objects is staggering and amazing.

I have large hands, and even with a 5/8' (1.5cm) seam allowance I sometimes had trouble doing things like under-stiching and wrangling the clothing into place. Looking at the flat fellted seams on my store bough dress shirts and know what goes into creating things like pant fly's, pant yokes or dress collars and cuffs really makes you appreaciate the skill in making clothes.

# The hardest part of the whole skirt was the hem. 


# Next I want to make the following items:

 - A Dress / Business shirts that fit me well. Again mostly because I'm a human and not a maniquen that my broad shoulders usually mean I have a baggy shirt around my waist if I wear store bought stuff. Surely the cheaper and easier option will be to just learn to sew, buy all the materials and construct my own shirts. Nothing can go wrong. 

 - A roll top hiking pack. A lot of people make these for themselves, so why not me. 

 - A midweight sports jacket. Again, I don't think the store price reflects the labor involved and I'd like to know what the labor looks like.
