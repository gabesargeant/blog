I didn't like how the images on the site were scaling on mobile. 

I assumed I was up for the challenge of getting it done right. 

I was wrong. 

the case sensitivity of paths became a thing. I think I've had this problem again. Anyway. referenceProject needed to be referenceproject for the updates to work. And i've retired the **image** short code I wrote about in part 1. And replaced it with the **img** one that I boosted from a few different write ups on the web.
