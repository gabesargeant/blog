If you're reading this in the far, far future, The year was 2021 and it got off to a nutty start.

The whole world was watching the US election and that COVID pandemic. And then, as if that wasn't enough, there was an attempted insurrection in America on 6th of January, 2021. 

At this point, I finally broke, and I got a twitter account to watch it all unfold. I was actually meant to be taking a day off work to start a long weekend with my wife. It turned out we both just watched news all weekend. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. 

Over the next few days until Joe Biden got sworn in as the US president, I read a lot of Twitter and News. One facinating thing that was visible during the aftermath of the event, was the groups of people trying to identify the individuals involved. It was really interesting watching investigative outfits like [bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) and others scour through the social media putting the clues together.

It' got me thinking about the future of survelience software, and anti-facial recognition. 



Identifying idiot terrorists. 

Gear and clothing and sloppy tradecraft. 




The broader lesson. Feature and Object recognition is more going to be more important than face recognition.

Antifacial recognition can only happen legislatively. It's not practically possible to be 'unseen' when you have a mixture of humans and technology scanning for people.
