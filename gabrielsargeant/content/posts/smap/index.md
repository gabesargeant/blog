*If you're reading this in the future, then hopefully everything is still working!*

For the full write up of how I built this site have a read of [Lambda Mapping Project]({{< ref "/posts/lambdamapping/index.md" >}} "Lambda Mapping Project")

And for fun, contrast what I built with my initial design. [Spelling Lambda]({{< ref "/posts/spellinglambda/index.md">}} "Spelling Lambda")

The next post is the retro, so that should be fun.
